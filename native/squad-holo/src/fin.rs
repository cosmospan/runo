//! Peek: Squad Code's mascot. Two eyes in a pill, drawn as an outline and
//! nothing else: every feeling is in the lids and how the pill moves.
//!
//! A port of the "Peek, alive" design. Like the bubble crew, a frame is a pure
//! function of time, so the same pose plays the same everywhere: blinks and
//! idle glances come from a steady hash of the clock, not from state.
//!
//! The types keep their Fin names ([`Fin`], [`FinPose`], [`Outfit`]) so saved
//! looks and the rest of the app carry over. Peek is only ever lines; a
//! [`Line`] sets their weight, colour and eye style. It can wear a hat on top and a badge on the
//! pill, and the prop it carries shows in a small badge beside it.
